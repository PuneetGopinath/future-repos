# Future Repos
> The repositories that will be available in the future

**Note: This repo is in construction.**

These repositaries listed below are repositaries wanted by users. I see many people ask `what project should I create, that solves users problems`. So I thought about a repo, that contains the list of repos wanted by users. Users can directly submit a pr to add the repo they want to this readme.

| Repo name   | Repo description                                       | Requested by    | Info |
